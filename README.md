# [Luck Calendar - www.xemngay.online](https://www.xemngay.online/)

## Overview
This is a unique web project I built to provide users with insights into the most auspicious dates and times for planning important events. Unlike other complicated platforms, **xemngay.online** offers an intuitive interface that lets users view good and bad luck hours across 7 days in a single glance. Designed for a younger audience, especially those unfamiliar with traditional feng shui practices, this web app presents a simple, modern solution for checking luck.

The project is built using **Java Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **Bootstrap 4**, demonstrating not only my full-stack web development capabilities but also offering a practical platform for refining my skills as an Automation Tester.

## Motivation & Learning Outcomes
The main motivation behind this project was to create a practical and user-friendly tool while sharpening my technical skills. Additionally, this project allowed me to explore the complexities of designing a fully functional web application while simultaneously preparing for challenges in **automation testing**.

### My Phylosophy When Making this Project
1. Luck is crucial. I don’t need to know if checking dates and times really matters, but I see it as a small investment with the potential for a huge upside if it’s true.
2. I see an automation tester as a developer with deep knowledge of testing, not just a tester who can code. That's why I ventured into building this web project

### Key Learning Points:
1. **Debugging and Problem Solving**: This project wasn’t simple. I encountered numerous bugs that required deep debugging sessions, particularly during the process of converting solar dates to lunar dates. This experience has helped me gain a better understanding of how to test and pinpoint issues efficiently.
   
2. **HTML Structure for Automation Testing**: Writing structured and detailed HTML is crucial. I learned that having too few attributes in HTML elements can make testing difficult, as many elements become similar and locating them through XPath becomes cumbersome.

3. **Handling Dynamic Data**: As the project dynamically generates luck scores and color codes based on user input, managing states and ensuring smooth transitions between views taught me a lot about how web applications manage complex datasets, further enhancing my testing strategies.

4. **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Ensuring responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) was a challenge that led me to better understand how to write tests for UI across multiple viewports.

5. **Learning Unit Testing**: While building this project, I realized the importance of unit testing to ensure the reliability of the core functionality, such as converting solar to lunar dates.


### Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap 4
- **Deployment**: Heroku (Continuous deployment)

## Future Developments
While the current version provides a solid foundation, I have several ideas for extending its functionality:
- **View Good Days**: Allow users to view a summary of good days over a 30-day period without needing to check specific time slots.
- **Print Feature**: Enable users to easily print the calendar for offline reference.
- **Embed Option (iFrame)**: Provide an option for other websites to embed the luck calendar via an iframe, allowing broader access to its features.
- **Mobile App**: Making a version for Android

## Conclusion
I enjoyed every step of creating **xemngay.online**. It allowed me to merge my interests in web development and automation testing into a single cohesive project. While it is not yet fully complete, I intend to continue improving and expanding this project over time as I develop new skills.
